# OneApply
One Apply is an all in one high school application portal. It was designed for students, admissions staff, and teacher/mentors. 
Students can look through all the different high schools in NYC, find out what programs they offer, and apply to that school all in one site. They can also get recommendations from teachers or mentors they request. Once applications are submitted they will also see the status and if they have been accepted or rejected for their various schools and programs. Lastly, they can request a recommendation to be completed from a teacher or mentor by simply entering their first name, last name and email address.
Admissions staff for high schools have access to all the applications in one place. They can filter based on program type and accept or reject applications directly from the detailed view of the application.
Teachers and mentors will receive an email with a link if they have been requested to complete a recommendation for a student. The link is no longer valid once a recommendation is completed!


## For Anyone Testing Our Website
It is important to test all features. There are a few premade accounts available but to get a real feel of how the site would work we ask you to please register as users to get the full experience. 

### Registration
###### Student Registration
Please note that when registering as a student the school you enter would be a middle school and due to no data being available about these schools, any name can be entered in that field.

###### Admissions Staff Registration
Please note when registering the email entered for the supervisor must be different than the email for the registering user.
Also, we are aware that manually entering the supervisor email can allow people to self approve when they actually do not belong to the school. This is just for the testing stage. In the future, all supervisor emails will be set automatically when a school is chosen with the email provided by the school. 

### Features that are currently not implemented yet
When logged in and clicked on the username in the top right corner a dropdown will show with options to change password and logout. The change password feature has not yet been implemented. 

#### If you have any questions feel free to reach out to any of the team members. Have fun testing!
